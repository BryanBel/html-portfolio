<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Bryan Belandria, a caucasian guy, 22 years old with a tiptop taste about rap, videogames and anime. I'm learning coding to be able to have a good job and escape from my country, trying to do multiple things at a time. Would like to be streamer, rapper and esport athlete.</p>

<p>Now, focusing on CODE, I'm learning JS and NodeJS, I hope to learn Python and have some projects in my portfolio.</p>

<p>I'm proactive, honest and consistent.</p>
