        <h3>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</h3>
            <p>Really surprising movie from Akira Toriyama and Toei, I think the best way to make canon Broly in the Dragon Ball universe, and not only that; the first appearance for Gogeta, very cool soundtrack and visual effects. LOVE IT!</p>

        <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
            <p>Super beatiful film. Really artistic. I love how Hayao Miyazaki captured every feeling.</p>
